Final Project Discrete Structures (CIS-7)
The purpose of this program is to encrypt, decrypt,
and display a Vigenere Table to a user. The program
starts by displaying a menu with options for the user
the first option is to encrypt a message, a second option
is to decrypt a message. A third option displays a Vigenere Table
if the user wishes to encrypt to decrypt the message manually
This is a User Controlled program. After the user encrypts,
decrypts, or is shown a Vigenere Table the program will ask 
the user if they would like to run the program again.
The program will run for as long as the user wants it to.
If the user enter an invalid menu option, they will be asked
to re-enter a menu choice. The message that is to be 
encrypted or decrypted must be entered as a single string
with no spaces, no numbers, and no special characters.
The user will also be asked to enter a shift number.
For encryption this is shift each character by the 
variable shift (which is entered by the user) units
to the right. For decryption it will shift each character
to the left by the number entered by the user. The program 
uses value returning functions, do while loop, a label, if/else if statements.
